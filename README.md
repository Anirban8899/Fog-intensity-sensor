• Designed and developed a Fog Intensity Sensor using Arduino for cooling tower applications, providing

           real-time fog density data.
      
        • Conducted thorough calibration and testing procedures to ensure accurate fog intensity measurements

           under varying fogging conditions in different loads.

        • Implemented a robust sensor system to provide reliable data, improving operational efficiency and 

          environmental control.
